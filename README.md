<b>Project complete</b>

# Project description
This project explored the effect of the pandemic on children and young people's health and the care they receive. The code was used to generate a measure of A&E attendances for an eating disorder in children and young people compared to adults. It also created a measure of time spent in A&E for mental health problems in children and young people.
